# LULCC-models
This is a first attempt to employ supervised classification algorithms to Land Use and Land Cover Classification of satellite images. 
We employed Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Multi-layer Perceptron models in order to compare their performance when classifying several classes of land
use and cover.
